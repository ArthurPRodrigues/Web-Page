        <p class="introduction">I was born and lived my whole life in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I'm 22 years old, Curently living in Santa Catarina since I was 19 yours old for a undergraduate program in Information Systems at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in the south of Brazil. I also work as a Tester at Bridge Laboratory, doing tests and making sure that our systems is good to go to the client. Nowadays, free time is not that abundant anymore so it's quite hard to find extra time to study a new technology but when I do have the time. I'm trying to teach me Java which is a hard language to understard but I'm sure I'll get it!
